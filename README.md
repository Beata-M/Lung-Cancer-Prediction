# Lung-Cancer-Prediction
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict lung cancer risk based on lifestyle, clinical, and environmental features. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the goal was to identify the most influential factors and evaluate model performance for early detection of pulmonary disease (used here as a proxy for lung cancer)
